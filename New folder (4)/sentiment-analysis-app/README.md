# Sentiment Analysis Application

This project is an AI-assisted tool designed to analyze comments received through the eConsultation module of the MCA21 portal. The application aims to facilitate the review of stakeholder feedback on proposed amendments and draft legislations by providing sentiment analysis, summary generation, and visual representation of keywords through a word cloud.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Predicts the sentiment of individual comments and calculates the overall sentiment from a collection of comments.
- **Summary Generation**: Produces concise summaries of stakeholder comments to highlight key observations.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Visualizes the frequency of keywords used in comments, providing insights into common themes and concerns.
